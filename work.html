          From the age of 4, when his dad came home with a playstation
          instead of groceries, Jack has been immersed in tech.
          <br />
          With a video game programmer for a father, Jack quickly
          learnt the value of incremental growth, thanks to games like
          Gran Turismo, Metal Gear Solid and Ridge Racer.
          <br />
          He also came to appreciate the reward in solving complex
          logic puzzles and the art of crafting an immersing story for
          a user.
          <br />
          To this day, he brings those lessons with him into each and
          every web project he creates and contributes to.

        <h3 class="content-paragraph">
          As a teen growing up in Vancouver Canada, with the iconic
          Stawamus Chief a short drive away, Jack discovered his
          passion for the sport of rock climbing.
          <br />
          Along his journey, Jack formed lasting connections with
          fellow climbers and the sport became an integral part of his
          identity.
          <br />
          Driven by a desire to give back to the community, Jack spent
          his youth working in local climbing gyms, sharing his
          knowledge and expertise with the young climbers of
          Vancouver.
          <br />
          Through climbing, Jack honed valuable skills that extend far
          beyond the walls of a climbing gym. Creative
          problem-solving, effective teaching, clear communication,
          and the establishment of trust became the foundation of his
          approach.
          <br />
          These skills now seamlessly translate to his work and
          collaborations in any professional environment.

        <h3 class="content-paragraph">
          As a young man seeking personal challenges, Jack turned to
          the world of joinery, eager to test his skills and
          creativity.
          <br />
          With a natural eye for detail and an unwavering commitment
          to quality, he quickly immersed himself in the art of modern
          woodworking.
          <br />
          From meticulously applying mirror-like finishes to kitchen
          cabinetry to the delicate hand-sanding of cocobolo suitcase
          handles in his father's woodworking shop, Jack pursued the
          elusive balance between perfection and the inherent beauty
          found in the natural imperfections of wood as a medium.
          <br />
          Through his dedication, Jack developed the skills to craft
          custom pieces to tolerances as fine as 1/16th of an inch.
          And whether deciphering complex blueprints for multi-story
          houses or constructing an entire kitchen from scratch, he
          thrived on the mental challenges and unwavering attention to
          detail required.
          <br />
          While Jack continues to push the boundaries of his
          professional achievements, his unwavering focus remains on
          providing beauty and value to those who experience his work.
