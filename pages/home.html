          From the age of 4, when my dad came home with a playstation
          instead of groceries, I have been immersed in tech.
          <br />
          With a video game programmer for a father, I quickly learnt
          the value of incremental growth, thanks to games like Gran
          Turismo, Metal Gear Solid, and Ridge Racer.
          <br />
          I also came to appreciate the reward in solving complex
          logic puzzles and the art of crafting an immersing story for
          a user.
          <br />
          To this day, I bring those lessons with me into each and
          every web project I create and contribute to.

          As a teen growing up in Vancouver, Canada, with the iconic
          Stawamus Chief a short drive away, I discovered my passion
          for the sport of rock climbing.
          <br />
          Along my journey, I formed lasting connections with fellow
          climbers, and the sport became an integral part of my
          identity.
          <br />
          Driven by a desire to give back to the community, I spent my
          youth working in local climbing gyms, sharing my knowledge
          and expertise with the young climbers of Vancouver.
          <br />
          Through climbing, I honed valuable skills that extend far
          beyond the walls of a climbing gym. Creative
          problem-solving, effective teaching, clear communication,
          and the establishment of trust became the foundation of my
          approach.
          <br />
          These skills now seamlessly translate to my work and
          collaborations in any professional environment.

        <h3 class="content-paragraph">
          As a young man seeking personal challenges, I turned to the
          world of joinery, eager to test my skills and creativity.
          <br />
          With a natural eye for detail and an unwavering commitment
          to quality, I quickly immersed myself in the art of modern
          woodworking.
          <br />
          From meticulously applying mirror-like finishes to kitchen
          cabinetry to the delicate hand-sanding of cocobolo suitcase
          handles in my father's woodworking shop, I pursued the
          elusive balance between perfection and the inherent beauty
          found in the natural imperfections of wood as a medium.
          <br />
          Through my dedication, I developed the skills to craft
          custom pieces to tolerances as fine as 1/16th of an inch.
          And whether deciphering complex blueprints for multi-story
          houses or constructing an entire kitchen from scratch, I
          thrived on the mental challenges and unwavering attention to
          detail required.
          <br />
          While I continue to push the boundaries of my professional
          achievements, my unwavering focus remains on providing
          beauty and value to those who experience my work.
